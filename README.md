# Habit

<br />

## Description

Habit is an app where a user can get, add, edit, and delete a habit or many habits, this is useful because some people have bad habits that they want to track, or good habits that they want to make sure they have done at a selected time.

## MVP

- A user should be able to get, add, edit and delete a habit.

- A habit should save to local storage.

## POST-MVP

- Maybe a authentication form where a user has to sign in and register in order to access his habits.

- Make it pretty.

## Challenges

- I'm used to making apps with a back-end but here all the habits are not really associated to a "user", they're saved to the local storage.

- All my CRUD apps are done with the React library, but I'm not confident in my ability to do CRUD actions in vanilla JS.

- The POST-MVP authentication form is an interesting challenge because the authenticated user is local-storage related, and not server related.

## Questions and Answers

- Q: Why vanilla ES6? can't you do this with any framework/library at a much shorter amount of time?

- A: Yes, I could do this in a much shorter amount of time with a framework like React, but I want to practice my fundementals which I have forgotten, React allows me to skip some of these fundementals and it has built some bad habits, see what I did there? You checked if you saw what I did there, now you're laughing, okay now you're creeped out because you're confused as to how I'm guessing how you're feeling at this exact moment while reading even though I'm not next to you, sorry.
